# Hiphip code for 2026

Used the template from Rev Robotics [click here!](https://github.com/REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-TemplateCHANGELOG.md) for the drivetrain. Code for the subsystems are from previous Hiphip code that has been updated. No more depreciated methods. 

## Description

This is code for Hiphip after Programming1 Laptop incident of 2/11/26 
Running this code should be safe. It lacks D-Pad controls for the operator controller, and fulcrum must be moved manually.
The programmers are scared to work with the fulcrum since the incident.
Other than the D-Pad, all code should function the same as previous years.

## Prerequisites

* SPARK MAX Firmware v26.1.0
* REVLib v2026.0.0

## In Memory of Programming1 Laptop
